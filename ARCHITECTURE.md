# ChatBot System Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the system architecture of the ChatBot backend application. The architecture follows a layered approach with clear separation of concerns, implementing various design patterns to ensure maintainability, scalability, and robustness.

## Architectural Layers

The system is organized into the following layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**
2. **Application Layer**
3. **Domain Layer**
4. **Infrastructure Layer**

### Presentation Layer

The presentation layer is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses.

#### Components:
- **Express.js Routes** (`src/routes/`)
  - Define API endpoints
  - Map HTTP verbs to controller functions
  - Handle path parameters and query strings

- **Controllers** (`src/controller/`)
  - Process incoming requests
  - Validate input data
  - Call appropriate service functions
  - Format and return responses

#### Design Patterns:
- **Front Controller Pattern**: Express.js acts as the front controller routing requests to appropriate handlers
- **Adapter Pattern**: Controllers adapt HTTP requests to internal service calls

### Application Layer

The application layer contains the business logic and orchestrates the application's functionality.

#### Components:
- **Services** (`src/service/`)
  - Implement business logic
  - Coordinate between different domain objects
  - Manage transactions and workflows
  - Handle cross-cutting concerns

#### Design Patterns:
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic is encapsulated in service classes
- **Facade Pattern**: Services provide simplified interfaces to complex operations

### Domain Layer

The domain layer contains the core business entities and rules.

#### Components:
- **Models** (`src/models/`)
  - Represent core business entities
  - Define data structure and relationships
  - Contain domain logic specific to entities

#### Design Patterns:
- **Domain Model Pattern**: Models encapsulate both data and behavior
- **Data Transfer Object (DTO) Pattern**: Objects used for transferring data between layers

### Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer provides technical capabilities and support for the upper layers.

#### Components:
- **Database Driver** (`src/dbDriver/`)
  - Handle database connections
  - Manage connection pooling
  - Implement retry logic

- **Middleware** (`src/middleware/`)
  - Cross-cutting concerns
  - Request/response processing
  - Security and logging

- **External Service Integration**
  - Ollama API client
  - RabbitMQ message broker
  - Third-party libraries

#### Design Patterns:
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction (implemented via Mongoose models)
- **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies are injected through middleware and imports
- **Middleware Pattern**: Express.js middleware for cross-cutting concerns

## System Components

RabbitMQ integration for asynchronous message processing.

#### Components:
- **RabbitMQ Middleware** (`src/middleware/rabbitMQ.js`)
  - Connection management
  - Channel creation
  - Error handling

#### Design Patterns:
- **Producer-Consumer Pattern**: Messages are produced and consumed asynchronously

### External Service Integration

Integration with Ollama AI service.

#### Components:
- **Ollama Service** (`src/service/ollama.service.js`)
  - API client implementation
  - Request/response handling
  - Error management

#### Design Patterns:

## Data Flow

### Normal Request Processing

1. **Request Reception**
   - HTTP request received by Express.js
   - Traceability middleware assigns request ID
   - Request logger starts timing

2. **Request Processing**
   - Middleware processing (security, parsing, etc.)
   - Rate limiting check
   - Request validation
   - Route matching and controller dispatch

3. **Business Logic Execution**
   - Controller calls appropriate service
   - Service processes business logic
   - External service calls (Ollama)
   - Database operations if needed

4. **Response Generation**
   - Controller formats response
   - Response sent to client
   - Request logger records completion

5. **Audit Logging**
   - Audit information stored in database
   - Messages sent to RabbitMQ queue

### Error Handling Flow

1. **Error Occurrence**
   - Error thrown in any layer
   - Caught by async error handler or Express.js

2. **Error Processing**
   - Error handler middleware processes error
   - Error-specific handling (validation, connection, etc.)
   - Error audit logging

3. **Error Response**
   - Appropriate HTTP status code
   - Formatted error response
   - Error information logged

## Design Principles

### Separation of Concerns

Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility:
- Routes handle URL mapping
- Controllers handle request processing
- Services handle business logic
- Models handle data representation
- Middleware handles cross-cutting concerns

### Single Responsibility Principle

Classes and functions are designed to have only one reason to change:
- Each middleware has a specific purpose
- Each service focuses on a specific domain
- Each model represents a single entity

### Open/Closed Principle

Components are open for extension but closed for modification:
- Middleware can be added without changing existing code
- New routes can be added without modifying the application setup
- Services can be extended with new methods

### Dependency Inversion Principle

High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules:
- Services depend on model interfaces, not implementations
- Controllers depend on service interfaces
- Dependencies are injected through parameters

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

The application is designed to support horizontal scaling:
- Stateless design allows multiple instances
- Shared database for data consistency
- Message queues for inter-instance communication

### Performance Optimization

Several performance optimization techniques are implemented:
- Connection pooling for database and message queues
- Asynchronous processing
- Efficient request/response handling
- Caching where appropriate

### Fault Tolerance

The system includes several fault tolerance mechanisms:
- Retry logic for database connections
- Graceful error handling
- Circuit breaker patterns for external services
- Health checks and monitoring

## Security Architecture
